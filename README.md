# Game Hub

To build this project I have utilized Vite to create a React app using Typescript as well as Chakra UI component library.

To run this project you need to first download it and then open a terminal window in the downloaded file's directory. Run the following commands:

```bash
   code .
   npm install
   npm run dev
```
